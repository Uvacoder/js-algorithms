### Basics
For the first three there is no use of arrays, instead use of objects with numeric keys. Not even 
used `Object.keys()` or `for (key in obj) {//etc...}` to loop over the keys.
These classes are implemented making use of the pseudo-classical approach.

### Advance
For the rest making use of the the new [ES6 class definition][classes]. It is assumed that the `value`
property of each element is a string or a number.
