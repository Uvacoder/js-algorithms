# Data Structures

## Table Content

1. [x] ~~[Queue](./queue)~~
2. [x] ~~[Stack](./stack)~~
3. [ ] [Linked List](./linked\ list)
4. [ ] [Set](./set)
5. [ ] [Tree](./tree)
6. [ ] [Hash Table](./hash\ table)

### Basics
For the first three there is no use of arrays, instead use of objects with numeric keys. Not allowed 
to use `Object.keys()` or `for (key in obj) {//etc...}` to loop over the keys.

### Advance
Every data structure in this corresponds to a class in the code (use pseudo-classical approach, or the new [ES6 class definition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)).
It is assumed that the `value` property of each element is a string or a number.
