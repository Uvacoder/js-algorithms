# Tree

[Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure))

Implementation:
- `addChild(node)` - Adds a child (which is a new sub-tree) to the current node and returns `true`.
- `contains(value)` - Returns a boolean, reflecting whether the value can be found in the current node or any of its children.
