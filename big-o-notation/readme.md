# Big O Notation

## Complexity
* Space complexity
  * How much memory is it used??
* Time complexity
  * How much time is it needed, how many operations do you have to do??
    * Number of comparissons made?
    * Number of swapsss?(sorting)
  * It is relative to that is why we use the time complexity notation(relative speed):
    * Machine
    * Language
    * Data set


| Name        | Notation |
| ----------- |:--------:| 
| constant    | O(1)     |
| logarithmic | O(logn)  |
| linea       | O(n)     |
| quadratic   | O(n^2)   |
| exponential | O(k^n)   |
| factorial   | O(n!)    |
