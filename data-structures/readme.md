# Data Structures

Containers for data that fits different needs.

The data in the data structures are processed by certain operations. The particular data structure chosen largely depends on the frequency of the operation that needs to be performed on the data structure:
* Traversing
* Searching
* Insertion
* Deletion
* Sorting
* Merging

## Table Content

1. [x] ~~[Queue](./queue)~~
2. [x] ~~[Stack](./stack)~~
3. [x] ~~[Linked List](./linked\ list)~~
4. [x] ~~[Set](./set)~~
5. [ ] [Tree](./tree)
6. [ ] [Hash Table](./hash\ table)

## Notes
* No use of arrays instead objects. 
  * No use of `Object.keys()` or `for (key in obj) {//etc...}` to loop over the keys.
* Some classes are implemented making use of the pseudo-classical approach.
* Some others make use of the the new [ES6 class definition][classes].
